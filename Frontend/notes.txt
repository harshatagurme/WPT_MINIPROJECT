By default every server follows CORS policy
CORS: Cross Origin Resource Sharing
Frontend: 192.168.34.22
Backend: 192.172.18.14

by default server has blocked the requests from all the clients
in our backend application we have to specify from which client we have to accept
the request or from which client you don't want to 

We have to allow a cors policy 
to allow the CORS policy we need to deal with request headers but if 
we don't want to write entire code for dealing with request headers for the cors
then we will use a module i.e. cors
